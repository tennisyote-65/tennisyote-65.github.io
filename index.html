I am a junior Business Administration major and Los Angeles Dodgers fan. I grew up in Knightdale, North Carolina. I have been a Carolina Hurricanes fan since the Hurricanes won the Stanley Cup in 2006. 
I enjoy video games, and I used to go outside during the summer to catch lightning bugs. I played baseball from age 4 to age 13 and once played in a tournament in Cooperstown, New York.
My favorite fictional book series is The Chronicles of Narnia. I have also seen the three movies that are based on the series.
